# Sorting Visualizer!

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! As i was learning different sorting algorithms, i thought of visualizing it in actions. So i built this website. I learned a lot during this journey. Until now there is five algorithms, in future i will try to implement some more.

## My process

### Built with
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling
- Context API - For state management
- [React Js](https://nextjs.org/) - JavaScript Framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot while building this website. I also implemented testing using Jest and React-testing-library. I learnt more about SASS and Context API. I also improved my problem solving skills writing down the algorithms for animating and sorting the array and properly visualize it.
